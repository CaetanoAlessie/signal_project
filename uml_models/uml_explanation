Alert Generation System:
This system works around the AlertGenerator which monitors patient data such as heart rate and blood 
pressure from the DataStorage class. It checks this data with predefined limits and if they go over those 
limits it creates an Alert object detailing the alert. The Alert contains information like patient ID, the specific 
medical condition, and the time of the alert. These alerts are managed by the AlertManager, which is responsible 
for making sure that alerts are quickly sent to the medical staff for them to care of.

Data Storage System:
At the center of the data storage system is the DataStorage class which keeps PatientData, a class containing 
individual patient metrics and timestamps. DataStorage can use methods such as retrieval, storage, and deletion of 
data, making it possible to access to patient information in real time, which is important for constantly monitoring 
patients. The PatientRecord class holds details such as name, date of birth, and medical history which is accessible 
through the Retriever class which gets this data from DataStorage.

Patient Identification System:
Patient identification is handled by the IdentityManager and PatientIdentifier. The IdentityManager verifies the 
authenticity of patient IDs given by the PatientIdentifier which matches incoming data to the existing patient records. 
This system makes sure that all medical data and alerts are correctly matched with the correct patient. This is 
important in order to maintain data integrity and privacy.

Data Access Layer:
The Data access layer includes multiple listener classes such as the TCPListener, WebSocketListener, ConsoleListener, 
and FileDataListener each implementing the DataListener interface. These listeners are each made to receive data through 
specific protocols, ensuring correct and accurate data listening from multiple sources. They play an important role in 
sending this data into the DataStorage, they provide a continuous and reliable way for data to travel which is essential 
for the system's operations.
